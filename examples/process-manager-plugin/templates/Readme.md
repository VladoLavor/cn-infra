# Process manager template scenario

The example shows how to create or generate a process template, how to use it to run process or how to run
processes on plugin start up.

Note: in order to run a part of the example which handles templates, process manager config file needs to be provided
to the example, otherwise it will be skipped.

```
./process-manager-plugin -process-manager-config=<path-to-file>
```

All about process manager config file can be found in process manager [readme](../../process/README.md#Templates)
