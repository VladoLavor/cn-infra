# Process manager example

The example consists of three parts:
* simple process managing like creating a process, start, stop, restart of status watching
* more advanced status handling as attaching to running processes, reading of process status file or automatic restarts
* all about templates, how to create and use it

The example uses [test-application](test-process/test-process.go) called test-process, which is managed during
the example.
